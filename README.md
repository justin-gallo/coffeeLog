# coffeeLog
A simple app to track &amp; rate different types of coffee. 
Developed to practice working with Objects & Constructors in JavaScript. 

###*Things I Learned*
* How to implement modal elements which are hideable with button presses. 
* Changing CSS properties via Javascript. 
* Making a button toggle itself between two states with CSS/JS (good/bad coffee btn)
* Accessing objects within arrays and manipulating the DOM with that data
* Placing a querySelectorAll() within a function, and calling that function after creating new elements to add those new elements to a selection. 

###*Features to Add*
* Remove button to each card to remove that respective coffee object.
* Wrap input fields in a <form> tag to allow for validation methods to be used (such as maximum character counts).
